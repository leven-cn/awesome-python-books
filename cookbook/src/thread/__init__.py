'''Multi-threading Programming.

In CPython, due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), only one thread can
execute Python code at once (even though certain performance-oriented
libraries might overcome this limitation).If you want your application to make
better use of the computational resources of multi-core machines, you are
advised to use multiprocessing. However, threading is still an appropriate
model if you want to run multiple I/O-bound tasks simultaneously. In other
words, I/O bound Python applications stand a much better chance of being able
to take advantage of a multi-threaded environment than CPU-bound one.

**NOTE**: While the `import` machinery is thread-safe, there are two key
restrictions on threaded imports due to inherent limitations in the way that
thread-safety is provided:

    - Firstly, other than in the main module, an `import` should not have the
      side effect of spawning a new thread and then waiting for that thread in
      any way. Failing to abide by this restriction can lead to a deadlock if
      the spawned thread directly or indirectly attempts to import a module.

    - Secondly, all `import` attempts must be completed before the interpreter
      starts shutting itself down. This can be most easily achieved by only
      performing imports from non-daemon threads created through the threading
      module. Daemon threads and threads created directly with the `thread`
      module will require some other form of synchronization to ensure they do
      not attempt imports after system shutdown has commenced. Failure to
      abide by this restriction will lead to intermittent exceptions and
      crashes during interpreter shutdown (as the late imports attempt to
      access machinery which is no longer in a valid state).
